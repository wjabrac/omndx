"""Lightweight cryptographic helpers.

This module intentionally sticks to the Python standard library so that it
can operate in minimal environments without external dependencies.  The
helpers provided here are **not** intended for high security scenarios but
offer basic primitives that are sufficient for tests and demonstrations.

Functions
---------
``generate_key``
    Return a random key suitable for the helper functions.
``encrypt`` / ``decrypt``
    Symmetric XOR based transformation of byte strings.
``hash_data`` / ``verify_hash``
    SHA-256 based hashing with a random salt and constant time verification.
