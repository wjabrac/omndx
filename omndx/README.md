# OMNDX Platform

This directory contains the early scaffolding for the OMNDX plug-and-play LLM
mount and agent system.  The current codebase focuses on defining the core
interfaces and documenting the responsibilities that each component must
implement for a production-grade deployment.

## Core Modules

- `core/agent_forge.py` – outlines the factory for constructing agents from
  templates.
- `core/agent_router.py` – documents request routing logic to dispatch tasks to
  the correct agent.
- `core/orchestrator.py` – specifies workflow orchestration requirements.
- `core/sandbox_manager.py` – describes secure execution of untrusted tools.
- `core/symbolic_planner.py` – details planning utilities for turning goals into
  executable steps.
- `core/task_registry.py` – defines the registry structure for task metadata.

Each module includes detailed docstrings that enumerate the tasks required to
complete the implementation.  No functionality is provided yet.
