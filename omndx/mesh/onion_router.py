"""Simple onion routing simulation.

The real world concept of onion routing involves wrapping a message in layers
of encryption and forwarding it through a number of intermediate peers.  Each
peer peels away a single layer thereby revealing the address of the next hop
until the final recipient is reached.  Implementing the cryptographic aspects
is far beyond the scope of this repository, however a tiny subset of the
behaviour is useful for unit tests.

The :class:`OnionRouter` class provided here performs purely logical routing â€“
no encryption is attempted.  A message is forwarded through a list of peer
identifiers, and only the final peer receives the delivered message.  The
intermediate hops do not retain the message which mirrors the anonymity aspect
of onion routing.
