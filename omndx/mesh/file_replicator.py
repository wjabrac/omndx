"""Utilities for replicating files across peers.

The :class:`FileReplicator` class is a deliberately small abstraction which
allows a :class:`~omndx.mesh.mesh_peer.MeshPeer` to share byte content with other
peers in the network.  Each peer maintains a mapping of file name to bytes in
memory â€“ persistence and conflict resolution are outside the scope of these
tests.

Replication is bandwidth aware; the owning peer's
:class:`~omndx.mesh.bandwidth_balancer.BandwidthBalancer` is consulted before
each transfer and a :class:`RuntimeError` is raised if the peer exceeds its
budget.  For the simple scenarios in the tests this provides sufficient
behaviour to reason about redundancy and throttling.
