    Necessary production features:

    * Launch sandboxed processes or containers with strictly limited

    * Validate tool images/binaries against a whitelist and integrity checks.
    * Stream stdout/stderr for real-time monitoring and capture telemetry.
    * Enforce execution timeouts and terminate rogue processes.
    * Emit security audit events and metrics for each execution.
