multiple agents, external tools, and data stores.  The scaffold below details
features that must be implemented for a production-grade orchestrator.

    * Interpret workflow definitions expressed as DAGs or state machines.
    * Allocate execution slots and manage concurrency limits.
    * Provide transactional semantics and rollback on failure.
    * Persist intermediate state for auditability and replay.
    * Expose instrumentation hooks for metrics, logging, and tracing of each
