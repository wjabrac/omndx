"""Symbolic planning utilities for long-horizon tasks.

The :class:`SymbolicPlanner` translates high-level goals into concrete steps
that can be executed by agents.

TODO:
- Telemetry: emit detailed planning traces.
- Metrics: measure plan search complexity and success rates.
- Security: validate goal inputs and control action execution.
- Resiliency: adapt plans when environment state changes.

    Required development tasks:

    * Parse and validate goal specifications using a formal grammar.
    * Build and manipulate symbolic representations of the environment and
      agent capabilities.
    * Perform search/optimization to find feasible action sequences while
      respecting constraints.
    * Adapt plans in response to runtime feedback or changing state.
    * Integrate with observability to expose planning metrics and decision

        This lightweight implementation accepts either a string describing
