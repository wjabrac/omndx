    Required development tasks:

    * Parse and validate goal specifications using a formal grammar.
    * Build and manipulate symbolic representations of the environment and
      agent capabilities.
    * Perform search/optimization to find feasible action sequences while
      respecting constraints.
    * Adapt plans in response to runtime feedback or changing state.
    * Integrate with observability to expose planning metrics and decision

        * Explore candidate strategies using heuristics or learned models.
        * Produce a minimal, verifiable action list and emit a plan identifier
          for tracking.
        * Surface detailed reasoning traces for audit and debugging.
